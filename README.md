Info
---------------------

Scripting in illustrator is a shitty job, sorry for my honesty. It seems that Adobe gave up the development because I stumbled upon a lot of "bugs". Well, the code acts differently than doing the exact same thing manually in illustrator. Most of the time you'll be better off doing something manually than writing a script for it. However, it seems that the scripting in inDesign is more advanced since you're able to manipulate more, such as creating windows. However, if you're still interested in learning it, 90% of the time I used the adobe documentation: http://wwwimages.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/illustrator/sdk/CC2015/Illustrator%20Scripting%20Reference%20-%20JavaScript.pdf which sadly is a pdf (wtf?!) and 5% the very well written https://github.com/jtnimoy/scripting-for-illustrator-tutorial tutorial (sadly, not complete at all yet). You'll see that there is not much adobe scripting going around and you'll have hard times finding documented stuff. Please let me know if you stumble upon some good documentation. Thanks. Enjoy.
